# AI Agent Project

> A pragmatic, user-first AI agent system built with lessons learned from past experiences.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

- **Simplicity First**: Start small, expand only when validated
- **User Value**: Every feature must solve a real user problem  
- **Rapid Iteration**: Ship weekly, learn constantly
- **Cost Conscious**: AI costs must be sustainable

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aiagent.git
cd aiagent

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Minimal)

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (simple and proven)
- **Frontend**: Next.js (if needed)
- **Database**: SQLite to start, PostgreSQL when scaling
- **AI**: Single API integration (OpenAI/Anthropic)
- **Deploy**: Vercel/Railway (one-click deploy)

## 📊 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MVP (Week 1)
- [ ] Single AI agent with specific task
- [ ] Simple API endpoint
- [ ] Basic web interface
- [ ] User authentication

### Phase 2: User Validation (Week 2)
- [ ] Deploy to 10 beta users
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Iterate on core features
- [ ] Measure engagement

### Phase 3: Scale When Ready
- [ ] Only add features users request
- [ ] Optimize for most used workflows
- [ ] Consider additional agents/features

## 💡 Lessons from Past

From the Aesthetic Genesis Engine project, we learned:

1. **Start with ONE agent, not five**
2. **MVP in days, not months**
3. **User feedback > Perfect architecture**
4. **Simple code > Clever code**
5. **Ship early, ship often**

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- User activation rate > 60%
- Weekly active usage > 40%
- User-reported value > 8/10
- AI cost per user < $1/month
- Time to first value < 5 minutes
